## Getting Started

This repository contains the package with generic utils functionality.

## Build Process

### **1. Clone codebase via `git clone` command**

Example:

```
git clone https://github.com/diia-open-source/be-pkg-utils.git pkg-utils
```

---

### **2. Go to code base root directory**

```
cd ./pkg-utils
```

---

### **3. Install npm dependencies**

The installation of dependencies consists of the following 2 steps:

#### **1. Manually clone, build and link dependencies from `@diia-inhouse` scope**

Each Diia service depends on dependencies from `@diia-inhouse/<package>` scope which are distributed across different repositories, are built separately, and aren't published into public npm registry.

The full list of such dependencies can be found in the target service `package.json` file in `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections respectively.

Detailed instructions on how to link dependencies from `@diia-inhouse/<package>` scope are described in `LINKDEPS.md` which can be found here
https://github.com/diia-open-source/diia-setup-howto/tree/main/backend

#### **2. Install public npm dependencies and use those linked from `@diia-inhouse` scope**

In order to install and use the linked dependencies for `pkg-utils` the following command can be used:

```
$ cd ./pkg-utils
$ npm link @diia-inhouse/db @diia-inhouse/redis ... @diia-inhouse/<package-name>
```

In case all dependencies from `@diia-inhouse` scope are linked, and can be resolved, you will then have a complete list of dependencies installed for the service code base.

---

### **4. Build package**

In order to build the service you have to run the command `npm run build` inside the root directory of service code base as per:

```
$ cd ./pkg-utils
$ npm run build
```
